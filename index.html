              It is not intended to provide you with all information about each dinosaur, nor general tutorials for the game.

              Percentages especially are tricky to determine precisely.
              If a specific value doesn't have any decimal places, that could be because it happens to be exactly that value,
              but also because I might have been too lazy to determine it more precisely. Feel free to contribute ;)

              You can click columns to sort, and hovering over them shows a tooltip with a short explanation.
              Click the ‚ìò icon to show mutations.

              AI stats are approximate, since they can only be roughly determined by experimentation.

              Unfortunately, results for AI damage in particular were extremely inconsistent. This is likely
              because the player takes more damage depending on where they get hit (head, body, tail), and it's
              hard to tell where you are hit. Also, I don't know the exact damage multipliers for each body
              part, especially considering they are not the same for each dino.<br/>
              There may also be other factors affecting the damage measurement.

              AI weight (= HP) should be fairly accurate, excluding fish or if listed with a question mark.

            <h4>Carrying capacity</h4>
            <p>
              The maximum weight of a corpse that still allows you to carry it while running is determined via a
              fixed percentage for each dinosaur (see the respective column).
              However, experimenting with this behaviour has shown that the general rule of weight = HP is not
              consistent for some of the smaller AI.
              For example, carno can carry chickens once at 60kg, and rabbits once you weigh 80kg.
              This implies a weight of 6kg and 8kg for chickens and rabbits respectively, but you need more bite
              force than that to kill one. In the carry weight column, these different weight and HP values are
              marked by adding the actual HP (accuracy is subject to measuring errors) in parentheses.
            </p>
            <p>
              Side note: you can't carry corpses at all when below your freshspawn growth threshold,
              just like you can't eat on your own and require feeding at that growth stage.
            </p>
            <p>Some notes on corpse carry percentages beyond the info in the carry weight column:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Deinosuchus' 25% carry percentage differs from the max grab weight for live dinos, which is
                  50% for victims on land and 75% for those that are swimming.
                </li>
                <li>Pteranodon's carry weight includes both running and flying, and is unusually high (relatively
                  speaking) meaning you can steal chickens at 12kg already.</li>
                <li>Troodon: 10% (this means you need to be fully grown just to carry a chicken)</li>
                <li>Galli: 10% (only applies to frogs and crabs)</li>
                <li>Beipi: 10% (only applies to frogs and crabs; when you can carry either, you can also eat it (whole))</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <h4>Gallimimus egg theft</h4>
            <p>
              Gallimimus is explicitly described as an egg thief, which means they're able to eat eggs. However,
              they're not quite as adept at eating eggs as carnivores.
              Specifically, if you're playing Galli, you can only grab eggs directly from a nest and eat them
              right away. You cannot pick them back up if you drop them, and you also cannot eat from eggs on the
              ground. In other words, if you steal an egg and drop it, you will not be able to eat it or interact
              with it in any way.
            </p>
            <h4>Fish</h4>
            <p>
              Unlike other AI, fish size is not fixed. Instead, it depends on the size of the dino catching it.
              This is especially true for schooling fish, which can weigh substantially less than even just 1kg if
              caught by a freshly hatched (not spawned) deinosuchus, and up to around 25-30kg if caught by an
              adult deinosuchus.
            </p>
            <p>
              Elite fish also definitely vary in size, but the difference is not quite as pronounced here, with much smaller
              weight spans. It's also unclear if the size difference is caused by the size of the dino that
              caught it, or if they simply have varying weights by nature.
            </p>
            <p>
              Note that freshy caught elite fish do not seem to be subject to the usual carry weight percentages.
              In other words, you may be able to catch an elite fish and carry it on land, but won't necessarily
              be able to pick it back up if you drop it.
